##  üòû The Problem

Homelessness is a major issue in NYC, impacting individuals and communities profoundly. Lack of shelter, healthcare, and job opportunities makes it tough for homeless people to regain stability and feel connected. Streamlining access to vital resources is crucial in tackling this challenge, and achieving this involves enhancing communication among organizations to strengthen an individual's care journey.

  

##  üìù Summary

In recent years, homelessness in New York City has surged to its highest levels since the Great Depression, with a staggering 92,879 homeless individuals, including 33,399 children, seeking shelter each night in the city's municipal shelter system as of November 2023. This crisis is exacerbated by a multitude of factors, including a severe shortage of affordable housing, triggering causes such as eviction and domestic violence, and the prevalence of serious health issues among homeless single adults, including mental illness and addiction disorders. Despite efforts to accommodate asylum seekers and new arrivals, the total number of people sheltered in various systems has reached approximately 123,000 by December 2023. Furthermore, while homelessness disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic/Latinx New Yorkers, it spans across all community districts, underscoring the pervasive nature of the issue within the city's fabric.

  

##  ü§î Our Hypothesis

If organizations working with homeless individuals have access to communication avenues of resources tailored to different neighborhoods, such as resources or space in shelters, then they will be better equipped to provide holistic support, leading to more effective long-term solutions and reducing the cycle of homelessness.

##  ü´Ç Who do we serve?

Although the homeless are the main beneficiaries of this program, they may not have immediate internet connection. People who work with the homeless, such as social workers, churches, police officers, food banks, shelters, nonprofit organizations, community centers, mental health/substance abuse treatment centers, schools, and various social media advocacy groups, will be the primary users of this app.

  

##  üß≥ User Journey Map

Jessica, a social worker who specializes in assisting victims of domestic violence, begins by assessing an individual who is at risk of homelessness. Jessica is worried that if they leave their violent circumstances without a detailed safety plan, the victim won‚Äôt get the proper help they need. The ideal plan is to develop a safety strategy, but that requires many moving parts and resources that need to be gathered, and Jessica does not know where to start. She uses the application to tailor a selection of resources based on the individual's needs and location in NYC. She arranges for quick, practical support for the sufferer by contacting local services through the application. Furthermore, Jessica provides continuing support to help the individual move to a more secure existence, emphasizing a comprehensive approach that goes beyond simply providing resources.
