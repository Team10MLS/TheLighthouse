# The Lighthouse

The Lighthouse is an app that serves as a communication hub that serves to help organizations and advocates of those experiencing or at risk of homelessness, connecting them with vital resources and information they can pass on to those in need. The mission of The Lighthouse is to increase communication between entities that are typically discrete, to ensure a smooth continuum of care for individuals experiencing housing instability.
